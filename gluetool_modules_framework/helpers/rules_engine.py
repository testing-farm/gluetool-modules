class RulesEngine(gluetool.Module):
    """
    Simple "rule" evaluation engine. Allows users to use subset of Python language
    in their configuration, for example to decide which section of a config file to
    use. Module using such configuration just need to provide necessary context, e.g.
    objects that are available to the rules the module supports.

    To write rules, a restricted set of Python expressions is provided. Following
    Python constructs are allowed:

        * comparisons: ``==``, ``<=``, ``not in``, etc.
        * strings, numbers, lists, tuples;
        * logic operators: ``and``, ``or``, ``not``;
        * ``... if ... else ...`` expressions;
        * calling a function or method;
        * list, tuples, dicts and list comprehensions.

    Strings have two extra methods, providing access to regular expression functionality:

        * ``match(pattern, I=True)``
        * ``search(pattern, I=True)``

    Few helper functions are available as well:

        * ``ALL(iterable)``, returning ``True`` when all items of iterable are true-ish;
        * ``ANY(iterable)``, returning ``True`` when any item of iterable is true-ish;
        * ``EXISTS('foo')``, returning ``True`` when the variable named ``foo`` exists.

    Custom functions are supported via ``--functions`` option. Listed files are loaded and
    any global object with name not starting with `_` becomes part of ``rules-engine`` eval
    context. These functions can be called, and they are given eval context as their first
    argument implicitly.

    Custom variables are supported via ``--variables`` and ``--user-variables`` options.
    Listed YAML files are expected to contain key:value mappings which are then loaded and:

        * ``variables``: key:value pairs will be exported into ``rules-engine`` eval context.
        Values can be complex objects and lists, they are exported as-is, with no additional
        processing.
        * ``user-variables``: key:value pairs will be available via ``user_variables`` shared
        function. On every call, the values - which support templates - are re-rendered.

    .. code-block:: yaml

       # variables
       NAMES:
         - foo
         - bar
         - baz: 79

       # user-variables

       NAME: |
         {% JENKINS_JOB_NAME == 'foo' %}
           some-value
         {% else %}
           some-other-value
         {% endif %}

    Users of this module would simply specify what objects are available to rules in their
    domain, and then provides these objects when asking ``rules-engine`` (via the shared
    function) to evaluate the rules.

    For example, a module M promises its users that current user's username would be
    available to rules M is using for its functionality, as a variable ``USERNAME``.
    Such rules can then look like ``USERNAME.match('f.*')``, or ``USERNAME == 'foo'``.
    If M is used by user named ``foobar``, the first rule would evaluate to ``True``,
    while the second would be false-ish.
