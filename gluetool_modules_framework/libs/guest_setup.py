"""
Common API for modules providing ``setup_guest``  shared functions.

The ``setup_guest`` should perform actions to prepare the given guest for more work. The whole process is often
implemented by multiple modules in a chain. To ease cooperation, this module provides simple definition of
structure all ``setup_guest`` functions should return, and states few basic rules.

* every ``setup_guest`` function returns a list of :py:class:`GuestSetupOutput`.
* if ``setup_guest`` function called its predecessors, its output structures should be added to the list it obtained
  from the predecessors.
* every ``setup_guest`` function focuses on a single guest at a time. If user needs a parallel execution,
  we can provide :py:mod:`gluetool_modules_framework.libs.jobs` for that purpose.
* every ``setup_guest`` should accept ``log_dirpath`` parameter - all files produced by the setup process should
  land in this directory. Module is free to create subdirectories for subtasks.
