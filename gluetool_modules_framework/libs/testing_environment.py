    To specify what environment should provisioner provide when asked for guest(s), one needs to
    describe attributes of such environment. It's up to provisioning modules to decode the information,
    and provision guest that would - according to their best knowledge - satisfy the request.

    Follows :doc:`Testing Environment Protocol </protocols/testing-environment>`.

    .. note::

       This is effectively a work in progress - we need to separate environments from provisioners
       and test runners, and that would let us make modules less dependant on the implementation
       of guests.

    :param str compose: Identification of the compose to be used for testing. It can be pretty much
        any string value, its purpose is to allow provisioning modules to chose the best distro/image/etc.
        suitable for the job. It will depend on what modules are connected in the pipeline, how they are
        configured and other factors. E.g. when dealing with ``workflow-tomorrow``, it can carry a tree
        name as known to Beaker, ``RHEL-7.5-updates-20180724.1`` or ``RHEL-6.10``; the provisioner should
        then deduce what guest configuration (arch & distro, arch & OpenStack image, and so on) would satisfy
        such request.
    :param str arch: Architecture that should be used for testing.
    :param bool snapshots: Choose a pool with snapshots support.
    :param str pool: Name of the pool to use for provisioning.
