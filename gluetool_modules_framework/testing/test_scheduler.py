    Prepares "test schedule" for other modules to perform. A schedule is a list of "test schedule entries"
    (see :py:class:`libs.test_schdule.TestScheduleEntry`). To create the schedule,
    supporting modules are required, to extract test plans and package necessary information into
    test schedule entries. This module then provisions and sets up the necessary guests.

    Schedule creation has following phases:

        * scheduler prepares a set of `constraints` - what environments it is expected to run tests on;
        * test schedule entries are obtained by calling ``create_test_schedule`` shared function, which
          is given the constraints to be guided by them;
        * for every test schedule entry - and its environment - a guest is provisioned (processes all
          environments in parallel);
        * each guest is set up by calling ``setup_guest`` shared function indirectly (processes all guests
          in parallel as well).

    *Testing constraints patching*

    Sometimes the list of constraints needs to be updated before creating a schedule. Use ``--tec-patch-map``
    to do this. For each testing environment constraint, rules and actions are evaluated:

    .. code-block:: yaml

       ---
